I can view a list of all SolForge cards.
	Each card is represented by its name, faction, and rarity.
	
I can touch a card listing to view it.
	This view will render the correct art.
	I can either tap outside of the art to dismiss the view, or touch a button
	
I can scroll through the card's levels
	Perhaps by swiping, but buttons would be ok too.

I can add a card to a deck.
	I can do this from the search list view.
	Dragging from the search list to the deck list.
